# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are not maintaining multiple branches, so all fixes will be committed to head and included in the next release.

We take great care to maintain backwards compatibility, so we expect our users to use the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can reach us per email at info@libzip.org.

For less sensitive reports, you can also open an issue or pull request on GitHub.
