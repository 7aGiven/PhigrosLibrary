.Sh NAME
.Nm zip_source_zip ,
.Nm zip_source_zip_create
.Nd create data source from zip file (obsolete interface)
.Sh LIBRARY
libzip (-lzip)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In zip.h
.Ft zip_source_t *
.Fn zip_source_zip "zip_t *archive" "zip_t *srcarchive" "zip_uint64_t srcidx" "zip_flags_t flags" "zip_uint64_t start" "zip_int64_t len"
.Ft zip_source_t *
.Fn zip_source_zip_create "zip_t *srcarchive" "zip_uint64_t srcidx" "zip_flags_t flags" "zip_uint64_t start" "zip_int64_t len" "zip_error_t *error"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The functions
.Fn zip_source_zip
and
.Fn zip_source_zip_create
are the obsolete versions of
.Xr zip_source_zip_file 3
or
.Xr zip_source_zip_file_create 3
respectively.
If you want to get the compressed data of the complete file, use
.Dl zip_source_zip_file(za, source_archive, source_index, ZIP_FL_COMPRESSED, 0, -1, NULL)
.Pp
The functions
.Fn zip_source_zip
and
.Fn zip_source_zip_create
create a zip source from a file in a zip archive.
The
.Ar srcarchive
argument is the (open) zip archive containing the source zip file
at index
.Ar srcidx .
.Ar len
bytes from offset
.Ar start
will be used in the zip_source.
If
.Ar len
is 0 or \-1, the rest of the file, starting from
.Ar start ,
is used.
If
.Ar start
is zero and
.Ar len
is \-1, the whole file will be copied without decompressing it.
.Pp
Supported flags are:
.It Dv ZIP_FL_UNCHANGED
Try to get the original data without any changes that may have been
made to
.Ar srcarchive
after opening it.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the created source is returned.
Otherwise,
.Dv NULL
is returned and the error code in
.Ar archive
or
.Ar error
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn zip_source_zip
and
.Fn zip_source_zip_create
fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ZIP_ER_CHANGED
Unchanged data was requested, but it is not available.
.It Bq Er ZIP_ER_INVAL
.Ar srcarchive ,
.Ar srcidx ,
.Ar start ,
or
.Ar len
are invalid.
.It Bq Er ZIP_ER_MEMORY
Required memory could not be allocated.
.El
Additionally, it can return all error codes from
.Fn zip_stat_index
and
.Fn zip_fopen_index .
